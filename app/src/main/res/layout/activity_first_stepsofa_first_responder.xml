an accident of any kind is to stop, take a few deep breaths, and
perform a complete 360- degree sweep of the accident scene and your
surroundings. Remember, your safety is key, so be sure to assess any
safety issues before you proceed. Keep yourself safe by following these steps:

\n\n1. Park your vehicle in a safe spot that’s out of the way of any other moving vehicles, being careful not to block traffic.
\n\n2. Check for any visible fuel or potentially combustible liquid on the ground, and make sure to park a safe distance away if you find any.
\n\n3. Look for any downed power lines to avoid, put on your emergency brake and your hazard lights, and call emergency number.
\n\n4. Check for traffic and exit your vehicle.
\n\nDo not run across any busy traffic lanes; you will not be able to help if you also become injured.\n"/>

\n\n1. Bring the first-aid kit from your vehicle and quickly but
 carefully approach the scene while scanning and assessing
\n\n2. Shout, “I’m here to help, is anyone hurt?”
\n\n3. Ask the first person you see how many passengers he thinks are involved.
\n\n4. If everyone visible appears unconscious or unresponsive, do a fast
visual scan of the surrounding area for additional people that may
have been ejected as you move around vehicles.
\n\n5. If there are other adults with you or nearby, take charge and ask
for help as you need it in the most assertive way you can, without raising panic in others.
\n\nIt’s vital that professional rescuers and medical teams be on the way,
so if you have not been able to call emergency number, ask someone
else to call or go for help. Use common sense if you need to leave
the scene to summon help yourself. Note if there are unmoving
persons in the vehicles. If a small fire or heavy smoke is coming
from the front of a car, threatening any passengers inside, then
remove the persons from danger (without endangering yourself)
before going for help. Above all else, summoning help and enlisting
help in all your actions is a top priority.n\n"
